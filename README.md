## Dogon Pot
### Description:
A console line project focused on variable manipulation, conversion, and recursion.

### Premise: 
The program first checks if the pot has reached it's minimum diameter, if it has then the it draws the lid and exits, and if it has not then it draw the current diameter then shrinks the diameter by 2/3. The program then calls itself again and loops until the minimum diameter, the lid, has ben reached. Demostrating recursion.
